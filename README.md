# cloudflare-clone

Perfect â€” youâ€™re thinking like an architect now.
Letâ€™s design the **flow of your code** for a Cloudflare-style proxy.

---

# ðŸ”¹ High-Level Request Flow

Every request that hits your edge proxy should go through these **layers**, in order:

1. **TLS Termination**

   * Accept connection on `:443`.
   * Handle TLS handshake (using Letâ€™s Encrypt/ACME certs).
   * Negotiate ALPN (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`).

2. **Request Parsing**

   * Normalize URL, headers, method.
   * Generate a **cache key** (e.g., `METHOD + URL + VARY_HEADERS`).

3. **Security / WAF**

   * Run request through:

     * IP/ASN allow/deny lists.
     * Rate limiting (token bucket, sliding window).
     * Regex-based rules (block SQLi, XSS patterns).
   * If blocked â†’ return 403.

4. **Cache Lookup**

   * Check edge cache (Ristretto/BigCache).
   * If HIT â†’ return cached body + headers.

5. **Origin Fetch**

   * If MISS â†’ forward request to origin:

     * Maintain connection pools.
     * Add headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`).
   * Receive response from origin.

6. **Response Processing**

   * Run through optional response WAF.
   * Compress (gzip/brotli).
   * Store in cache (if cacheable).
   * Add metrics/logging.

7. **Send Response**

   * Return final headers + body to client.

# ðŸ”¹ In Code Terms (Go)

Think of it as a **pipeline (middleware chain):**

```go
IncomingRequest
   â†“
TLSHandler         // step 1
   â†“
RequestParser      // step 2
   â†“
SecurityMiddleware // step 3
   â†“
CacheMiddleware    // step 4
   â†“
OriginProxy        // step 5
   â†“
ResponseProcessor  // step 6
   â†“
ClientResponse     // step 7
```

Each block is a small, composable piece of code (like how `net/http` middlewares are built).

---

# ðŸ”¹ Minimal MVP Flow

For your **first prototype**, keep it small:

1. TLS Termination
2. Cache (simple in-memory map, no eviction yet)
3. Proxy to origin

WAF, rate limits, compression, logging â†’ can be added later.

ðŸ‘‰ Question for you:
Do you want me to **write out a skeleton Go project** with this flow (each step as a function/middleware) so you can start coding immediately?
